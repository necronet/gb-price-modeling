## About the data and its nature

Data contains the following information on a spreadsheet that was transform into a plain CSV file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(comment=FALSE),  message=FALSE}
<<raw_data>>
  colnames(raw_data)
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
